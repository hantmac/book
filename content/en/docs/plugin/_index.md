  We sorted out commonly used plugins in the community, especially some plugins in the Open-Falcon community that are out of repair. We guarantee that every plugin is usable and reliable.

The plug-in mechanism of Nightingale is similar to Open-Falcon, and the data structure is also compatible, so the plugin part can be found in [Open-Falcon](http://book.open-falcon.com/zh_0_2/usage/)ï¼ŒIf you find that some plugins cannot be used, please contact us, we will reorganize and maintain them.

Many plugins of Open-Falcon start a process directly or use CRON driver, and then push data to open-falcon-agent. If using Nightingale, push the address to the address of the collector, ie http://127.0.0.1:2058/api/collector/push.
